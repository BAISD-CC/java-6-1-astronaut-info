# Astronaut Information Storage Application

HR needs an application to store some personal information about our astronauts in case we need to get in touch with them.

## AstronautBuilder Class

Design a class named `AstronautBuilder` that will hold the following personal data about our astronauts: name, age, address, and phone number. Write appropriate accessor and mutator methods to store and retrieve the information sent from `AstronautInfo` and from the automated test class.

### Methods you need in AstronautBuilder to pass the tests:
- **setName** - Sets the name of the astronaut object.
- **setAge** - Sets the age of the astronaut object.
- **setAddress** - Sets the address of the astronaut object.
- **setPhone** - Sets the phone number of the astronaut object.
- **getName** - Retrieves the name of the astronaut object.
- **getAge** - Retrieves the age of the astronaut object.
- **getAddress** - Retrieves the address of the astronaut object.
- **getPhone** - Retrieves the phone number of the astronaut object.
